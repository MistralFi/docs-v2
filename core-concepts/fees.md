# Fees

## Overview

Our decentralized exchange uses a variety of automated market makers to allow for seamless trading. Whether it is stableswaps, correlated assets, blue-chips or altcoins, Mistral gives fair deals to its traders.

Mistral DEX offers swapping tailored to any nature of swaps. Whether it's swapping stablecoins or volatile tokens, fees are fair & attractive enough to swap through the exchange.

The swap fees are as follows:

* Stableswap & correlated token fees - 0.01-0.04%
* Bluechip fees - 0.25%
* Volatile token fees - 1%
* Flash loan fees - 0.03%

When performing a [flash loan](../balancer-v2-technology/flash-loans.md), users are able to trade at 0.03% fees.

### How are the fees used?

The fees are distributed in a variety of ways.

* 30% of the trade fees are distributed to [$veMSTRL](tokenomics/vebal-and-gauges.md) holders in the form of $KLAP3POOL - a weighted pool of 3 stablecoins.
* 50% go to a DAO controlled LP treasury meant for future growth initiatives.
* 20% are distributed to the team to fund further developments & infrastructure costs.

There are certain cases where fees are distributed for different circumstances.

* 20% of fees earned from boosted pools will be kept by the protocol, half of which will be used to burn $MSTRL tokens, the rest being sent to the team fund for upkeep costs.

All of the fees earned from penalty fees from withdrawing locked veMSTRL is distributed to [veMSTRL](tokenomics/vebal-and-gauges.md) holders.
