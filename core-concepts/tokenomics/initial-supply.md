# Initial Supply

Mistral has a maximum supply of 100 million $MSTRL tokens. Once minted, they are distributed to multi-signature wallets & smart contracts. The Mistral team cannot mint tokens after the initial supply has been minted.



### Where are the $MSTRL emission tokens located?

The emission tokens are sent to a smart contract that follows an emission schedule & distributes tokens to liquidity pools in accordance to their voted-on allocation. The allocation changes bi-weekly, when a voting epoch is initiated. To learn how to vote for a liquidity pool, check the [veMSTRL](vebal-and-gauges.md) page.  The emission schedule of the MSTRL tokens can be found [here](liquidity-providers.md#emission-schedule).&#x20;
