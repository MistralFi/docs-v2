# veMSTRL

### **Dynamics**

All the effects of ve(3,3) act in confluence to create a system in which swap fee performance is incentivized rather than total liquidity. Because veMSTRL holders dictate which liquidity pools get more emissions and receive swap fees as a reward, liquidity providers are encouraged to compete for generating the most swap fees. Mistral also provides a bribe market to aid in rewarding specific veMSTRL voting activity. The act of cooperation in common interests by participants with different objectives is manifested through veMSTRL voting for concentrating emissions in gauges that generates more swap fees while liquidity providers aim to receive most of MSTRL emissions by depositing liquidity in these highly incentivized gauges.This is the spirit of ve(3,3).\
&#x20;

### **veMSTRL(3,3) in a nutshell**

* MSTRL tokens can be locked for up to 16 weeks.&#x20;
* The amount of veMSTRL emitted decreases linearly with time, providing reduced MSTRL rewards for lockers.
* veMSTRL governs Mistral and drive MSTRL emissions with their votes for gauges. 90% of the MSTRL supply will be distributed to Liquidity Providers, veMSTRL votes decide which gauges will receive the incentives.
* veMSTRL holders receives all trading fees from the gauge they voted for, trading fees are 0.05%
* Liquidity providers in gauges receive the emissions directed to the gauge, but do not receive swap fees.
* The amount of MSTRL locked in relation to circulating supply directly affects the rate of emissions so that the more MSTRL tokens locked in veMSTRL, the slower the emissions.
* veMSTRL can down-vote gauges from receiving emissions to prevent spam.
* VEMSTRL can boost any amount of gauges and receive up to 2.5x more MSTRL rewards by providing liquidity in the boosted gauge.
* veMSTRL can receive bribes attached to a gauge by protocols when voting on the bribe interest gauge.
