# Core Pools

Core pools are pools on Mistral that have been whitelisted by the Mistral Community and are unrestricted in their emission allocation.

The core pools at launch will be as follows:

* MSTRL/sKLAY (80:20) - 1% fee
* sKLAY/klapUSDT/WETH/WBTC (25:25:25:25) - 0.25% fee
* USD Metastable pool (USDC/USDT/DAI) (33:33:33) - 0.01% fee
* sKLAY/klapUSDT (50:50) - 0.25% fee
* KLAY/sKLAY/AKLAY (33:33:33) - 0.04% fee

To make an ordinary pool turned into a Core pool, users must go through a governance process.
