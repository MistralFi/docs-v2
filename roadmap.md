# Roadmap

Mistral wants to become the main source of liquidity on the Klaytn blockchain. Nonetheless, we recognize the strong competitiveness now present and the need for differentiation so as to create and offer a unique product.&#x20;

To achieve this goal, various stages of development are necessary as well as leveraging the potential of the Balancer technology.&#x20;

### Phase 1: liquidity bootstrapping (120 days)&#x20;

During the initial phase after the launch, strong incentives to attract the necessary liquidity are distributed to users who decide to migrate their liquidity to Mistral.&#x20;

Core pools, the beating heart of Mistral, will receive the vast majority of distributions, while  veMSTRL token holders will receive 70% of  Protocol Fees (the remaining 30% is redirected to the treasury). The issuance of $MSTRL remains almost constant with at least 1.50 tokens per block.&#x20;

These initiatives are directly aimed at attracting an initial TVL of about 100M of KLAY tokens  and at encouraging veMSTRL locking, creating value from day one.&#x20;

### Phase 2: stabilization (180 days)&#x20;

During this phase, emissions are gradually reduced until they reach approximately 0.71 $MSTRL per block at the end of the period. Phase two is characterized both by the reduction in emissions and by the beginning of a gradual redistribution of protocol fees which are now also collected by the treasury in a more substantial way: 50% veMSTRL; 50% Mistral Treasury.

### Phase 3: Focusing on innovative solutions

As mentioned, Mistral wants to differentiate itself and create added value by leveraging the incredible capabilities of its technology. For this reason, we are already testing innovative solutions that allow us to maintain a strong advantage over the rest of the competition. This is only possible thanks to a team that has extensive experience and knowledge of Mistral's potential and that makes our Decentralised Exchange the most advanced and efficient on the market.
